This is a music mod that brings the excitement of Digivolution to life by randomizing classic anime-inspired, vocalless PS1 tracks from **Digimon Rumble Arena** for the Digivolution scenes in Digimon Story Time Stranger.

**Key Features:**

  * **Classic Digivolution Sound:** Replaces Digivolution tracks with iconic, instrumental themes from *Digimon Rumble Arena*â€”no vocals, pure nostalgia.
  * **Randomized Tracks:** Each Digivolution event can play one of several alternative tracks, keeping the experience fresh and unpredictable.
  * **Integrated SFX:** Each track includes sound effects from classic Digimon Story games, mainly Digimon Story DS, to ensure the digivolution sequence remains impactful even with new music.
  * **Smooth Reverb Ending:** Every track features a custom reverb ending for seamless transitions, making the music feel natural as you play.

## **Randomized Digivolution Tracks**

Tracks are organized by cue, each representing a Digivolution sequence. For each cue, the following tracks are randomized:

### **Standard Digivolution**

- **Brave Heart**  
  *Preview: [Digimon Rumble Arena Brave Heart (Vocalless PS1 Instrumental)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW2wwb3nDGM)*

- **Break Up**  
  *Preview: [Digimon Rumble Arena Break Up (Vocalless PS1 Instrumental)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uenaxe-QnDE)*

- **EVO**  
  *Preview: [Digimon Rumble Arena EVO (Vocalless PS1 Instrumental)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCQ5J27-nzk)*

### **Short Digivolution**

- **Brave Heart (Short)**  
- **Break Up (Short)**  
- **EVO (Short)**  

### **Important Note:**
```
Each Digivolution sequence will randomly select one of these tracks, making every transformation unique and memorable. If you skip the Standard Digivolution animation, the music will switch to one of the Short Digivolution tracks, chosen at random. 

For example: If Brave Heart is playing during Standard Digivolution and you skip the animation, the mod will immediately select and play one of the three Short Digivolution tracks instead.
